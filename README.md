# Botson: Anson, but a bot
**planned functions:** <br>
* access to jmdict, weblio, and kotobank dictionaries<br>
  * pretty stuff like buttons to scroll through entries <br>
* japanese quizzes (and other quizzes)
* creating menus using new button functionality
* basic bot functionality like scheduling messages <br>
* access to google calendar through discord

**not so sure:** <br>
* slash commands - currently difficult to implement. might wait for discord.js
